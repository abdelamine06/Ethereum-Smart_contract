###Â Decentralized Computer.
A decentralized computer is like a normal computer. A normal computer executes a program using one machine.

But a decentralized computer executes a program using multiple machines. Every machine needs to agree upon the output of the program for its results to become official.

To build a decentralized computer, here are the essential elements:

##### 1 - smart contract language.
##### 2 - blockchain.
##### 3 - network.
##### 4 - Transactions and accounts.
##### 5 - state management data structure.
